This MUD example helps you to categorize a polygon
Think of a polygon in your mind.
:llet
ask:Does the polygon contain more than 6 sides? "yes" or "no"
next:1:yes:more_than_6
next:2:no:less_than_6
>>>

<<<
state:more_than_6
tell:
Your polygon has more than 6 sides
:llet
ask:How many sides does the polygon have? "7", "8", "9", "10", "more"
next:1:7:heptagon
next:2:8:octagon
next:3:9:enneagon
next:4:10:decagon

<<<
state:less_than_6
tell:
Your polygon has less than 6 sides
Next, the question is about whether the sides are all of equal length
:llet
ask:Are all sides of the polygon of equal length? "yes" or "no"

tell:
Now, I will ask about the number of sides again
:llet
ask:How many sides does the polygon have? "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"
